- 👋 Hi, I’m @salylgw
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, Math, Computing, Technology, Semiconductors, Embedded Systems, Genetic Engineering, Finance etc. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep Learning and Flutter.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on several of my proof-of-concept projects that solve problems using Math and AI.
  * First of these is [SPOT](https://github.com/salylgw/gammath_spot) -- a Stock Price-Opining Toolset.
- 💞️ I'm a multilingual engineer. I mean, I've used many programming languages (C, C++, Assembly, Verilog, System Verilog, Perl, Python, Rust etc.) in my professional career.
  However, majority of the time, I had been programming closer to the hardware so my proficiency is highest in C and I consider myself a  *beginner* (< 3 years experience) in all other languages.
  As a result, I'm also looking to collaborate with Python experts to improve my Python code.
